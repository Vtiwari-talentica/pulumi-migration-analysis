# Migration Analysis: applications (ArgoCD GitOps Repository)

## Executive Summary

**DISCOVERY**: The applications repository is **NOT a Pulumi project** but rather an **ArgoCD GitOps configuration repository** that manages customer application deployments using Helm charts. This repository contains 552+ tenant configuration files across multiple application components.

**Migration Impact**: **NO DIRECT PULUMI MIGRATION REQUIRED** - This is a GitOps/ArgoCD repository that does not use Pulumi Cloud backend.

**Relationship to Pulumi Migration**: This repository contains the **application layer configurations** that get deployed to the Kubernetes clusters created by the Pulumi infrastructure repositories (cluster-master, cluster-services-master, tenant-master).

**Purpose**: ArgoCD GitOps configurations for customer application deployments  
**Technology**: ArgoCD ApplicationSets + Helm Charts + GitOps

## Technical Architecture Analysis

### ArgoCD GitOps Pattern
This repository implements a **hierarchical ArgoCD deployment pattern**:

1. **ApplicationSet Controller**: Creates one parent application per customer cluster
2. **Parent Application**: Deploys customer-specific Helm chart configurations
3. **Child Applications**: Individual service deployments (ASP, Airflow, Datadog, etc.)
4. **Tenant Configurations**: Customer-specific overrides in `tenants/*.yaml` files

### Key Components

#### 1. **Cequence ASP (Core SaaS Platform)**
- **111 customer configurations**
- Helm-based deployment with customer-specific sizing
- Features: API security, bot analyzer, WAF, API testing
- Resource configurations: 2.5M+ requests sizing, ARM64 support
- Integration with secrets management (Vault paths)

#### 2. **Airflow (Data Workflows)**
- **63 customer configurations**
- Customer-specific data pipeline configurations
- Integration with GitLab for DAG management
- Authentication via shared credentials

#### 3. **Parent Application Orchestration**
- **61 tenant orchestration configs**
- Defines which applications are enabled per customer
- Manages customer-specific overrides and configurations
- Controls application lifecycle via ArgoCD

### Customer Segmentation
The repository shows evidence of similar customer segmentation patterns:
- **Standard Customers**: Full application suite enabled
- **Enterprise Customers**: Custom sizing and configurations
- **Development Environments**: Reduced application sets
- **Specialized Customers**: Specific feature flags and customizations

### Dependencies on Pulumi Infrastructure
This ArgoCD repository has **critical dependencies** on the Pulumi infrastructure:

1. **Kubernetes Clusters**: Deployed by `cluster-master` (80+ EKS clusters)
2. **Platform Services**: Operators from `cluster-services-master` (100 environments)
3. **Networking & Ingress**: DNS, certificates from `tenant-master` (99 environments)
4. **Shared Services**: Secrets, routing from `account-services` (4 environments)

## Migration Impact Assessment

### Direct Migration Impact: NONE
- **No Pulumi Cloud dependency**: Repository uses GitOps/ArgoCD, not Pulumi backend
- **No state migration required**: ArgoCD manages application state, not Pulumi
- **No stack configurations**: Uses Helm values and ArgoCD configurations

### Indirect Migration Impact: HIGH
- **Dependency on Pulumi Infrastructure**: All applications deploy to Pulumi-managed clusters
- **Service Disruption Risk**: Pulumi infrastructure migration could affect ArgoCD deployments
- **Configuration Updates Required**: May need DNS/ingress updates during Pulumi migration
- **Timing Coordination**: ArgoCD deployments must be paused during cluster migrations

## Recommendations for Pulumi Migration Coordination

### Pre-Migration Preparation
1. **ArgoCD State Documentation**: Document current application deployment state
2. **Configuration Backup**: Backup all customer-specific configurations
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Map application dependencies to Pulumi infrastructure
4. **Customer Communication**: Include ArgoCD application impact in customer notices

### During Pulumi Migration
1. **ArgoCD Sync Pause**: Disable automatic sync during infrastructure migration
2. **Application Health Monitoring**: Monitor application status during cluster migrations
3. **Configuration Updates**: Update DNS/ingress references as needed
4. **Gradual Re-enablement**: Re-enable ArgoCD sync after infrastructure stabilization

### Post-Migration Validation
1. **Application Functionality**: Validate all customer applications are operational
2. **Configuration Integrity**: Verify all customer-specific configurations are preserved
3. **Performance Baseline**: Establish new performance baselines post-migration
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update any infrastructure references in configurations

## Timeline Integration with Pulumi Migration

### Phase Alignment
- **Pre-Migration (Weeks 1-4)**: ArgoCD state documentation and backup
- **Migration Execution**: ArgoCD sync disabled during cluster migrations
- **Post-Migration (Weeks 1-2)**: Application validation and re-enablement
- **Ongoing**: Monitor application performance and customer satisfaction

### Risk Mitigation
- **Application Rollback Procedures**: Prepare for rapid application restoration
- **Customer Impact Minimization**: Coordinate with customer success teams
- **Alternative Deployment Options**: Prepare manual deployment procedures if needed
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement additional monitoring during migration period

## Key Insights for Overall Migration Strategy

### Revised Customer Environment Count
The applications repository confirms the scale discovered in Pulumi repositories:
- **cequence-asp**: 111 customer application configurations
- **airflow**: 63 customer data pipeline configurations  
- **parent-application**: 61 customer orchestration configurations

This **validates the 100+ customer environment scale** discovered in the Pulumi repositories.

### Application Complexity Factor
The ArgoCD configurations reveal additional complexity layers:
- **Multi-component Applications**: Each customer has 5-8 application components
- **Custom Sizing Configurations**: Performance tiers from small to 2.5M+ requests
- **Feature Flag Management**: Customer-specific feature enablement
- **Secret Integration**: Complex secret management with Vault integration

### Customer Success Considerations
- **Zero Application Downtime**: Customers expect continuous application availability
- **Configuration Preservation**: All customer customizations must be preserved
- **Performance Maintenance**: Application performance cannot degrade during migration
- **Support Continuity**: Application support must continue throughout migration

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Treat as Migration Dependency, Not Migration Target
- Applications repository requires **coordination** but not **migration**
- Focus on **timing and communication** rather than technical migration
- Ensure **application teams are aligned** with infrastructure migration timeline

### 2. Enhance Customer Communication
- Include **application impact assessment** in customer communications
- Provide **application-specific status updates** during migration
- Offer **dedicated application support** during migration windows

### 3. Application-Aware Migration Planning
- **Sequence migrations** to minimize application disruption
- **Batch customers** with similar application configurations
- **Validate applications** as part of infrastructure migration success criteria

### 4. Long-term Operational Integration
- **Document application dependencies** on Pulumi infrastructure
- **Establish monitoring** for application health post-migration
- **Create procedures** for coordinated infrastructure and application changes

## Conclusion

The applications repository represents the **customer-facing application layer** that depends entirely on the Pulumi-managed infrastructure. While it doesn't require direct Pulumi migration, it significantly increases the **complexity and risk** of the overall migration project by adding:

- **Application continuity requirements** for 100+ customers
- **Multi-component dependency management** across 8+ application types
- **Customer experience preservation** throughout migration process
- **Coordinated rollback procedures** spanning infrastructure and applications

This discovery reinforces that the Pulumi migration is not just an infrastructure change but a **comprehensive platform transformation** affecting every aspect of customer service delivery.
