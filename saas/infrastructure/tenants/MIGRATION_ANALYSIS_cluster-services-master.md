# Pulumi Migration Analysis: cluster-services-master

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The cluster-services-master repository contains **100 customer environments** (confirmed by stack file count), representing Kubernetes services deployed to each customer's EKS cluster. This repository deploys platform services (Kafka, Elasticsearch, monitoring, GitLab runners) to the clusters created by cluster-master.

**Migration Complexity: EXTREME (Level 5)**
- 100 customer environments requiring individual migration
- Critical production services with zero-downtime requirements  
- Complex multi-component Kubernetes operators
- Custom ECR registry patterns for air-gapped customers
- International compliance requirements (China AWS partition)

## Repository Overview

**Repository**: cluster-services-master  
**Purpose**: Deploy Kubernetes platform services (operators, monitoring, CI/CD) to customer EKS clusters  
**Stack Count**: 100 customer environments  
**Primary Language**: TypeScript  
**Pulumi Project**: saas-tenant-cluster-services  
**Dependencies**: cluster-master (cluster infrastructure), account-services (shared services)

### Current Pulumi Cloud Configuration
- **Organization**: `cequence`  
- **Project**: `saas-tenant-cluster-services`  
- **Stack Pattern**: `cequence/saas-tenant-cluster-services/{customer-name}-{env}`
- **Backend URL**: Pulumi Cloud (app.pulumi.com)

## Technical Architecture Analysis

### Infrastructure Components
1. **Kubernetes Operators**:
   - Strimzi Kafka Operator (message streaming)
   - Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) - logging/observability
   - KEDA (autoscaling)
   - AWS Load Balancer Controller
   - Cert-Manager (TLS certificates)
   - Metrics Server

2. **CI/CD Infrastructure**:
   - GitLab Runners (customer-specific CI/CD)
   - Custom runner configurations per tenant
   - Registry authentication management

3. **Storage & Networking**:
   - AWS EFS CSI Driver
   - NFS Provisioner (optional)
   - VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler)

4. **Security & Compliance**:
   - Trivy Operator (vulnerability scanning)
   - Custom ECR registries for air-gapped customers
   - Certificate management with prod/staging issuers

### Key Dependencies
- **Cluster Infrastructure**: References `cequence/saas-tenant-cluster/{stack}` for cluster details
- **Shared Services**: Uses account-services for DNS, routing, secrets
- **Custom Components**: Extensive use of `@cequence/pulumi-k8s` library
- **External Services**: GitLab API integration for runner management

### Environment Variations
- **Standard Customers**: Full operator suite enabled
- **China Customers**: AWS partition `aws-cn`, limited services, custom ECR
- **Air-gapped Customers**: Custom ECR repositories, restricted networking
- **Compliance Customers**: Additional security operators, enhanced monitoring

## Migration Risk Assessment

### Risk Level: EXTREME (5/5)

**Critical Risk Factors**:
1. **Zero Downtime Requirement**: Customer production workloads cannot tolerate service interruption
2. **Complex State Dependencies**: Kubernetes operators manage persistent resources (StatefulSets, PVCs)
3. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: 100 independent customer environments requiring individual migration
4. **International Compliance**: China partition customers have restricted connectivity
5. **Custom Component Library**: Heavy dependency on proprietary `@cequence/pulumi-k8s` components

**Specific Technical Risks**:
- **Kafka Clusters**: Strimzi operator manages persistent Kafka clusters with consumer group state
- **Elasticsearch**: ECK operator manages persistent indices and cluster state
- **GitLab Runners**: Active CI/CD pipelines cannot be interrupted
- **Certificate Management**: TLS certificates must remain valid during migration
- **Load Balancers**: AWS ALB/NLB resources tied to Kubernetes services

### Customer Impact Assessment
- **Immediate Impact**: Service degradation/outage for 100 customer environments
- **Business Impact**: Direct customer-facing production service disruption
- **Compliance Impact**: China customers require special handling due to network restrictions
- **SLA Impact**: Potential breach of customer SLAs for availability

## Migration Strategy Recommendations

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Preparation (4-6 weeks)
1. **State Backup Strategy**:
   - Export all Kubernetes operator CRDs and their state
   - Document persistent volume dependencies
   - Create rollback procedures for each operator type

2. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Create isolated test environment replicating production setup
   - Test migration procedure with non-critical tenants first
   - Validate state transfer for each operator component

3. **Coordination Planning**:
   - Customer notification timeline (minimum 2 weeks advance notice)
   - Maintenance window scheduling (prefer off-peak hours per region)
   - Rollback criteria and procedures

### Phase 2: Pilot Migration (2-3 weeks)
1. **Select Low-Risk Customers**:
   - Choose development/staging environments first
   - Select customers with flexible maintenance windows
   - Avoid China partition customers initially

2. **Migration Procedure**:
   - Export current Pulumi state
   - Export Kubernetes operator state
   - Transfer to self-hosted backend
   - Import Kubernetes operator state
   - Validate all services operational

### Phase 3: Production Migration (8-12 weeks)
1. **Batch Processing**:
   - 5-10 customers per maintenance window
   - Regional grouping to minimize timezone impact
   - 48-hour monitoring period post-migration

2. **Special Handling**:
   - China partition customers require separate coordination
   - Air-gapped customers need on-site support
   - High-volume customers get dedicated migration windows

### Phase 4: Validation & Optimization (2-4 weeks)
1. **Post-Migration Validation**:
   - Verify all operators functioning correctly
   - Confirm persistent data integrity
   - Test disaster recovery procedures

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize self-hosted backend for operator-heavy workloads
   - Implement monitoring for migration success metrics
   - Document lessons learned for future migrations

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 4 weeks)
1. **Executive Approval**: Secure budget and timeline approval given extreme complexity
2. **Team Assembly**: Recruit/assign dedicated migration team with Kubernetes operator expertise
3. **Customer Communications**: Begin early engagement with customers about upcoming migration
4. **Risk Assessment**: Conduct detailed risk assessment with customer success teams

### Strategic Considerations
1. **Consider Alternative Approaches**: Evaluate if some services could be migrated to managed alternatives (e.g., Amazon MSK for Kafka)
2. **Staged Migration**: Consider migrating cluster-services independently from cluster infrastructure
3. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure comprehensive backup strategy for all customer environments
4. **Insurance**: Consider cyber insurance coverage for migration activities

**CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION**: This repository represents the highest-risk component of the entire migration due to direct customer impact and complex operator state management. Consider this the "crown jewel" migration requiring maximum attention and resources.
